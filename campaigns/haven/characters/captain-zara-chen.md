# Captain Zara Chen

## Notes

Zara's player (Alex) wants to slowly reveal her backstory throughout the campaign. The Battle of Cygnus Gate is a key mystery - she witnessed something there that contradicts the official story, and now someone is trying to keep her quiet.

## Relationships

- **Jack Morrison** (rival): Former wingmate from military days. Complicated history.
- **Maven** (contact): Pays Maven for information about threats and opportunities
- **The Silence** (hunted by): A shadowy organization that seems very interested in keeping Cygnus Gate secrets buried
