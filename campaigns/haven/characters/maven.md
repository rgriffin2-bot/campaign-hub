# Maven

## What They Know

Maven has eyes and ears everywhere. They specialize in:
- Ship movements and cargo manifests
- Corporate secrets
- Historical records others have tried to bury
- The locations of lost things

## DM Notes

Maven is actually three people operating as one identity—a human, an AI, and something else entirely. They were created by the Archivists before that faction went silent.

They're terrified of the Silence and will do almost anything to avoid their attention.

## Secrets

Maven knows about the true nature of the Stewards but will never share this freely. This information is their ultimate insurance policy.

## Voice

Calm, measured, almost musical due to the modulator. Speaks in riddles when they don't want to answer directly. "Information flows like water—it finds its level."
