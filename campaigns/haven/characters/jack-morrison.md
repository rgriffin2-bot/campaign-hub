# Jack Morrison

## Role in Story

Jack represents the path not taken—what Zara might have become if she'd stayed. He's not a villain, but his by-the-book mentality puts him at odds with the crew's more flexible morality.

## Secrets

Jack knows more about what really happened at Cygnus Gate than he lets on. He's seen the classified reports. The official story is a lie, and he's complicit in it.

He's also been ordered to keep tabs on Zara. Someone high up wants to know what she's doing.

## DM Notes

Good for: creating tension, military complications, possible redemption arc

Voice: Formal, clipped, occasional moments of genuine humanity breaking through

Jack still cares about Zara, which makes everything more complicated. He wants her to be safe but can't protect her from what's coming.
