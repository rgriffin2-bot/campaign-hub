# Breathable Space

One of the most fundamental discoveries of early space exploration was that the void between stars is not entirely empty. A mysterious field permeates all of space, making it breathable and habitable in ways that defy classical physics.

## The Discovery

When humanity first ventured beyond Earth's atmosphere, scientists expected hard vacuum and instant death. Instead, they found that space itself was filled with a thin but breathable atmosphere - enough to sustain human life for extended periods without a spacesuit.

This discovery revolutionized space travel. Ships could have open-air observation decks. Crew could perform maintenance in shirtsleeves. The age of easy space colonization began.

## The Science (Sort Of)

No one fully understands the breathable field. Theories abound:
- Remnant of ancient Precursor terraforming
- Natural property of the universe we never noticed
- Side effect of FTL jump technology
- Deliberate ongoing maintenance by unknown forces

What we do know:
- The field extends throughout known space
- It provides roughly 18% oxygen, sustainable for humans
- Temperature remains stable around 15°C (60°F)
- The field somehow prevents radiation damage
- It doesn't work inside planetary atmospheres (they override it)

## Implications

Breathable space changed everything:
- Space stations don't need complete pressure sealing
- Ship hulls can have windows and open sections
- Emergency situations are less immediately lethal
- Pirates can board ships without cutting through airlocks

## The Mystery

The breathable field is accepted without question by most people - it's just how space works. But scientists and philosophers continue to debate what it means. If space itself is artificially maintained, who did it? Why? And what happens if they stop?
