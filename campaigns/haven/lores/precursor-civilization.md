# The Precursor Civilization

Long before humanity reached for the stars, another civilization dominated this region of space. Known simply as the Precursors, they left behind vast structures, incomprehensible technology, and endless mysteries.

## What We Know

The Precursors:
- Existed at least 10,000 years ago (possibly much longer)
- Built stations, gates, and megastructures throughout the region
- Possessed technology far beyond current human capabilities
- Disappeared suddenly and completely
- Left no bodies, no clear records, no explanation

## Precursor Technology

Precursor artifacts and structures demonstrate capabilities that remain beyond human understanding:

**Jump Gates**: The network of faster-than-light gates connecting star systems appears to be Precursor work. Humanity uses them but can't replicate them.

**Station Cores**: Many modern stations, including Haven Station, are built around Precursor infrastructure. These cores provide power and life support far more efficiently than human technology.

**Artifacts**: Scattered objects of unknown purpose. Some are clearly tools or devices. Others are decorative. Many defy categorization. All resist analysis.

## Theories of Disappearance

Countless theories attempt to explain what happened to the Precursors:

**The Transcendence Theory**: They evolved beyond physical form
**The War Theory**: They destroyed themselves in a catastrophic conflict
**The Exodus Theory**: They left this region of space for unknown reasons
**The Integration Theory**: They're still here, disguised or transformed
**The Catastrophe Theory**: An external force destroyed them

No theory fully explains the evidence - or lack thereof.

## The Search Continues

Archaeologists, treasure hunters, and scientists continue to search for Precursor sites. Each discovery raises more questions than it answers.

Some factions believe understanding Precursor technology is key to humanity's future. Others warn that we're playing with forces we don't understand. A few claim the Precursors are still watching, waiting.

## Haven Station Connection

Haven Station's core is one of the largest intact Precursor structures known to exist. The original station skeleton provided the foundation for everything built around it over the centuries. Some of the sealed sections in the Undercity are original Precursor construction, untouched for millennia.

Occasionally, strange things happen in these sealed sections - power fluctuations, unexplained signals, reports of ghostly visions. Station authorities dismiss these as superstition, but the stories persist.
