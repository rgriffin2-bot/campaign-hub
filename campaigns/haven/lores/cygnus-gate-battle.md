# The Battle of Cygnus Gate

## Official Account

According to the Terran Defense Force, the Battle of Cygnus Gate was a successful anti-piracy operation three years ago. A large pirate fleet had established a stronghold near the Cygnus jump gate, threatening civilian shipping. TDF forces engaged and destroyed the pirate base, eliminating the threat.

Casualties: 47 TDF personnel, estimated 200+ pirates
Civilian casualties: None reported
Outcome: Decisive TDF victory, piracy in the sector reduced by 60%

The operation is held up as an example of effective military action protecting civilian interests.

## What Actually Happened

The truth is far more disturbing and is known only to a handful of survivors and their superiors.

### The Contact

TDF forces did engage an unknown fleet near Cygnus Gate, but they weren't pirates. The ships were of completely unknown design - not human, not matching any known species or Precursor pattern.

When the TDF fleet arrived, the unknown ships attempted communication. The signals were incomprehensible, but the intent seemed peaceful - their weapons were not powered.

### The Incident

Someone - reports conflict on who - fired first. Whether it was a nervous gunner, a malfunction, or a deliberate decision, a TDF destroyer opened fire on the lead alien vessel.

The alien response was immediate and overwhelming. Their weapons technology was decades ahead of human capabilities. In the engagement that followed:
- 3 TDF destroyers were destroyed
- 2 more were crippled
- The civilian station Cygnus Outpost was caught in crossfire
- The alien fleet was eventually driven off or chose to retreat

### The Cover-Up

Within hours of the engagement, TDF high command implemented a complete information lockdown:
- All records classified at highest level
- Surviving crew sworn to secrecy under threat of treason charges
- Civilian witnesses from Cygnus Outpost "relocated for their safety"
- Official story of pirate engagement fabricated
- Evidence destroyed or sealed

The operation was declared a victory. Medals were awarded. The truth was buried.

## The Survivors

Captain Zara Chen was there. She saw the alien ships. She saw what really happened. She knows the official story is a lie.

Jack Morrison, her former wingmate, also survived. But he tells the official version now - either believing it or choosing to.

Other survivors are scattered. Some believe the cover-up was justified to prevent panic. Others, like Zara, can't accept the lie.

## The Silence

Since the battle, an organization known only as "The Silence" has been active - cleaning up loose ends, suppressing information, and dealing with anyone who gets too close to the truth.

Their resources suggest government backing, possibly from within the TDF itself. Their methods range from surveillance and intimidation to permanent solutions.

Zara Chen is on their list.

## The Aliens

No one knows who the aliens were, where they came from, or if they'll return. The fragments of their ships recovered from the battlefield were all confiscated and disappeared into classified research facilities.

Some questions haunt those who know:
- Were they Precursors, returned after millennia?
- Were they just passing through, and we attacked first contact?
- Will they come back?
- Are we ready if they do?

The official position is that there were no aliens. Just pirates. Just another day defending human interests in space.

Those who know the truth live with the weight of that lie.
