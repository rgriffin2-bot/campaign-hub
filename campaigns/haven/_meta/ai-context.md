# Haven Campaign Context

Haven is a space opera campaign set in a universe where space itself is breathable—ships sail between worlds like ocean vessels, and ancient alien artifacts dot the void. The players crew a free trader vessel navigating between corporate powers, pirate fleets, and the mysterious remnants of a precursor civilization.

## Key Concepts

- Space is breathable; ships function like sailing vessels

- Bio-mechanical entities called Stewards guard unknown secrets
- Mix of human and non-human species
