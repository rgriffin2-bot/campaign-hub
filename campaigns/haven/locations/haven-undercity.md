  The Undercity contains several sealed sections of the original Precursor
  station. The Silence operates a hidden base in one of these sections, using
  ancient Precursor technology to coordinate their operations. Only a few
  people know about this - Maven suspects it exists but hasn't confirmed the
  location.

# The Undercity

The Undercity is what happens when a space station grows for centuries without planning. It's the tangle of passages, chambers, and repurposed infrastructure beneath Haven Station's official levels - a place where authority doesn't reach and survival depends on knowing the right people.

## Layout

The Undercity isn't organized so much as it evolved. It includes:

- **The Deep Markets**: Black market trading posts where you can buy anything - weapons, drugs, forged documents, stolen goods
- **The Warrens**: Residential areas for those who can't afford (or don't want) legitimate housing
- **The Old Tunnels**: Maintenance passages and ventilation shafts connecting everything
- **The Sealed Sectors**: Ancient Precursor chambers that even the Undercity's residents avoid

## Society

The Undercity has its own social order, enforced by various gangs and criminal organizations. The main rule is simple: mind your business, don't bring heat from above, and pay your debts.

Key players:
- **The Red Hand Syndicate**: Largest criminal organization, runs most of the Deep Markets
- **The Null Brothers**: Cybernetically enhanced gang controlling several warrens
- **Independent Operators**: Smugglers, fixers, and others who work alone or in small crews

## Accessing the Undercity

There are dozens of ways down from the upper levels - some official maintenance access points, others improvised or illegal. Most residents of Haven Station pretend the Undercity doesn't exist, but everyone knows someone who knows someone who can get things from "below."

## Dangers

The Undercity is genuinely dangerous. Structural integrity is questionable in places, oxygen quality varies, and violence is common. Security forces from above rarely venture down, and when they do, they come in force.

Still, for those with nowhere else to go - refugees, fugitives, the desperate - the Undercity offers a place to disappear and start over.
