# Haven Station

Haven Station is a massive orbital construct that serves as the beating heart of the Haven Sector. Built around the skeleton of a derelict Precursor station, it has grown over centuries into a sprawling metropolis in space.

## Structure

The station is organized into several distinct sections:

**The Docks** (Rings 1-3): Miles of docking bays accommodating everything from personal shuttles to bulk freighters. Always bustling with activity.

**The Market** (Ring 4): The commercial heart of the station. If it's legal (and many things that aren't), you can buy it here.

**The Residential Rings** (Rings 5-8): Housing for the station's permanent population of roughly 500,000 souls. Quality ranges from luxury penthouses overlooking the stars to cramped hab-blocks.

**The Core**: The original Precursor structure at the station's center. Heavily modified over the centuries, it now houses the Council chambers, primary life support, and the main reactor.

**The Undercity**: The lawless lower levels where the station's infrastructure meets its criminal underworld.

## Government

Haven Station is officially governed by the Haven Station Council, a rotating body of representatives from the major trading guilds, resident factions, and community organizations. In practice, power is distributed among various competing interests, and the Council mainly exists to prevent any one group from dominating.

## Culture

Haven's culture is defined by diversity and pragmatism. People of all species, beliefs, and backgrounds coexist here, united mainly by the desire to make a living (or a fortune). The unofficial motto is "Credits talk, everything else walks."

## Notable Locations

- **Maven's Corner**: Information broker's establishment in the Market
- **The Rusty Bolt**: Popular bar and meeting place for ship crews
- **The Garden**: Upscale restaurant with real plants (a luxury in space)
- **The Undercity**: Lower levels where official authority doesn't reach
