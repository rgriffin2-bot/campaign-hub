# Haven Sector

The Haven Sector sits at the confluence of three major trade routes through the Shattered Expanse, making it one of the most strategically important regions in known space. No single faction controls it - instead, an uneasy balance of power keeps the sector nominally independent.

## Geography

The sector contains:
- Haven Station (the largest independent station in the region)
- The Debris Belt (asteroid field rich in salvage)
- Three jump gates connecting to neighboring sectors
- Numerous smaller stations and outposts

## Politics

Haven's independence is maintained through a delicate balance. The major powers (Terran Defense Force, Free Colonies, Corporate Consortium) all maintain a presence but none dare claim exclusive control - the resulting conflict would be devastating.

## Economy

Everything flows through Haven: legitimate trade, black market goods, information, refugees, mercenaries, and opportunities. If you need it and can pay for it, someone in Haven can provide it.

## Dangers

The lack of centralized authority makes Haven both free and dangerous. Piracy is common in the outer reaches, and disputes are often settled with violence rather than law.
